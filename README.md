# 🏢 Influencing Message Reception via Anchoring

## 📝 Description  
This project investigates how the **anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic** influences business decision-making, specifically in evaluating a company's quarterly sales performance. By manipulating initial sales forecasts (anchors), we examine how participants perceive actual sales outcomes and whether their interpretations are biased toward the provided anchors.

## 💡 Key Findings  
- Participants who received a **low anchor ($10M forecast, $15M actual)** were more likely to evaluate sales positively.  
- Participants exposed to a **high anchor ($20M forecast, $15M actual)** assessed sales performance less favorably.  
- These effects were **stronger when sales trends were negative**, reinforcing the influence of anchoring in uncertain situations.  
- The results highlight the impact of **expectation-setting in financial reporting and business communications**.

## 🧪 Experiment Design  
- **Between-subjects design**: Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups (control, low anchor, high anchor).  
- **Outcome measure**: Participants judged Q4 sales success after viewing an **upward or downward** sales trend chart.  
- **Recruitment**: 200 respondents were sourced through **Prolific** and completed the survey via **Qualtrics**.

## 📊 Analytical Methods  
- **Linear regression** and **logistic regression** models were used to quantify anchoring effects.  
- **Interaction effects** were analyzed to determine whether sales trend direction moderated the impact of anchors.  

## 🔍 Implications  
- **Business Strategy**: Companies can **frame financial results more favorably** by carefully selecting comparative figures.  
- **Investor Communications**: Understanding anchoring can help in **managing stakeholder expectations**.  
- **Behavioral Economics**: Reinforces the broader impact of **cognitive biases on decision-making**.

## 🚀 Future Directions  
- Expanding the study to **different business scenarios** to assess generalizability.  
- Testing **alternative, less contextually relevant anchors** to isolate the anchoring effect from logical inference.  
- Increasing sample size to further explore potential **interaction effects**.
